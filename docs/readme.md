# dnd spell thingy

  used for displaying dnd spell stuff

## info/layout
- `./sketches/` --> for the arduino sketches that are being used

## ideas/plans
* just a simple reference of warlock spells
* spell slot indicator with used number
* ability score details
* spell save/spell casting modifier
* maybe turn phase thingy
* try the different screens and report on them
* arduino uno r3 until familiar with parts
* would need to webscrape/rip the spell details
  - manually enter for minimal viable product

* pixel color 2d array for data
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqsGs-1pbVI
  * use pixel matrix for 'cells'
  * have the growing things via strategy pattern
  * needs to know about the roots to above ratio
  * graph for the nutrients

* need to do the AC/MAX HP/CURR HP/INITIATIVE/SPELLSLOTSS

##  changes/changelog/updates
* `[11/11/2023]` --> *copied across files from engg2000 code for starting out*
* `[16/11/2023]` --> *simple design to display character stats*
