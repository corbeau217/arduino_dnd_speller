# dnd spell thingy

  used for displaying dnd spell stuff

## info/layout
- `./sketches/` --> for the arduino sketches that are being used

## ideas/plans
* just a simple reference of warlock spells
* spell slot indicator with used number
* ability score details
* spell save/spell casting modifier
* maybe turn phase thingy
* try the different screens and report on them
* arduino uno r3 until familiar with parts
* would need to webscrape/rip the spell details
  - manually enter for minimal viable product


##  changes/changelog/updates
